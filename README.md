# Speed_Measure_C_MSP430
Embedded C code to measure speed of a moving magnet using hall sensors.

A project created while on Coop at EMTS Lab. The business need was to develop a device that can read the speed of a cart moving on a track.
2 hall sensors were used some distance apart, and a magnet was attached to one of the wheel frames of the cart.
Quick solutions were required so there may be a lack of comments/explainations. Feel free to reach out with any questions.
